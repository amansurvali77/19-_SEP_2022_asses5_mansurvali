                Using Lorem ipsum to focus attention on graphic elements in a webpage design proposal
                In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the
                visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used
                as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a
                process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication,
                without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

                Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by
                the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it
                nonsensical and improper Latin.
